# FeatherAI-Kiroween
Documentation Frontend and Example Projects for FeatherAI - The lightest Agentic AI framework you'll ever see

## PROMPT
I want you to build out the frontend-docs directory. It should be a static documentation website for the python package: FeatherAI - The lightest Agentic AI Framework you'll ever see. Its a lightweight python library that can be used to easily create, run, orchestrate and trace agents with tool calling and structured output. Please have a look at FeatherAI to see exact features. Make a sidebar on the left which holds the different features e.g. "Getting Started", "System Instructions", "Tool Calling", "Structured Output", "Multimodal" (see prompt.py and document.py), "Asynchronous Execution" (including async tools), "Examples" with some more complicated examples combining several features and "Featured Projects" which display https://piatto-cooks.com/ and https://www.mentora-kiro.de/

Please do not build out the entire website, some pages can be left as mock. Most important is that the base styling is done.


## STYLING

Please use tailwind css for styling. The website should be only available in darkmode. Use design/feather-ai-logo as the logo for the website. Use the followign foreground colors, which are all present in the logo:



# Colors:
PINK:

a) #be3389

BLUE VARIANTS:

a) #0357c1

b) #22c4e0

ORANGE/BROWN:

a) #dfa987



Also you can maybe use some of the other svgs found in design for some subtle background accents (if so please with low opacity to make them less visible)



You can link to the github repo: https://github.com/lucabzt/feather-ai



Ask clarifying questions before proceeding please. Do not look into nor take inspiration from the frontend directory.
